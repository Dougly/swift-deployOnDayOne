# Deploy on Day One

Welcome to Flatiron! 

You're going to be writing code every day that you're here, and today is no exception. Let's see what you remember from doing the prework and write a simple application to get to know one another. In this lab we'll check a few concepts. Most importantly, we are going to do some simple Swift work. Let's get started!

##Tips

- You'll have ~3hrs to complete this.
- If you feel stuck, ask your new best friends for help.
- Don't get bogged down in git (if you choose to use it)
	- Many of you will want to know the right way to do it, but however your team decides they want to tackle things is the right way to do it today.
- Types of questions you'll probably want to ask that we'd like you to decide with your group.
	- Should we all work on one computer or each do our own and use git to manage merging our work together?
	- How do we put all our changes into one repository?
- The most important things are getting something working and learning to work as a team. There really are no wrong answers. 
- Keep in mind that you don't need to build things in the order they are presented below! Start with the easiest possible thing that begins to attack the problem, and build from there.
- Have fun with your new best friends!

## Instructions

As you've just heard, we want to make sure you know that [imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is just a phase. Today we're going to get over our initial imposter syndrome by jumping right in. You'll be surprised at how much you already know and how fast you'll learn from your peers.

Your mission, the one you've already chosen to accept by being here today, is as follows:

Develop an application *with the person next to you* that runs in Xcode's simulator. Collaborate however you'd like: working on the same machine, each on your own, git, whatever! This appliation is meant to be a simple tic tac toe game. Some important notes to consider are as follows:

1)How would you faciliate a user playing against the computer vs playing with another user sharing the phone

2)How would the computer know where to play and when the game is over. 


Some important hints and reminders:

* Ask your neighbor for help!
* Google it!
* You'll want to write all of your code in the ViewController.swift file.
* If you finish early, think of other ways to make your user experience better!
